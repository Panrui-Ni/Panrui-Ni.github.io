This paper is about H-J equations with the Hamiltonian periodic in the unknown function. We proved that the set C of all c's such that

H(x,Du(x),u(x))=c

has viscosity solutions is a compact interval. We also proved that the solutions of

∂_t u(x,t)+H(x,∂_x u(x,t),u(x,t))=c

is uniformly bounded and equi-Lipschitz continuous for all c in C.
