In this talk, I discussed the ergodic problem, the large time behavior and the vanishing discount problem for Hamilton-Jacobi equations depending Lipschitz continuously on the unknown function. Particularly, I will focus on the equations with the Hamiltonian of the form λ(x)u + H(x,p), where λ(x) changes its signs.
