In this talk, I first introduced a discrete approximation of the implicit solution semigroup. The discrete nonlinear vanishing discount problem will be considered, where the Mather measures play a center role. I will also discuss the uniqueness of the discounted solution. It is a joint work with Maxime Zavidovique.
