I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr/), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), CNRS. I obtained my PhD degree from [Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University.

Research interest: Hamiltonian dynamics, Hamilton-Jacobi Equations, Weak KAM Theory and Aubry-Mather theory.
