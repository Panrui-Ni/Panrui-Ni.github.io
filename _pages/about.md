Welcome to my webpage!

I am currently a visiting researcher at [Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences, The University of Tokyo](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). My mentor is [Prof. Hiroyoshi Mitake](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ipRPxJIAAAAJ&hl=ja).

I was a postdoc at [Institut de Math√©matiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr/), from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. I was mentored by [Prof. Maxime Zavidovique](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~maxime.zavidovique/).

I obtained my PhD degree from [Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University. I was advised by [Prof. Jun Yan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jun-Yan-79).

My research interest includes Hamiltonian dynamics, Hamilton-Jacobi Equations, Weak KAM Theory and Aubry-Mather theory. You can find my CV here: [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
