Considered the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation

λu(x)+H(x,Du(x))=0,

where λ>0. We have known that there is a unique solution u_λ. The family {u_λ}_(λ∈(0,1]) is equi-Lipschitz continuous. Therefore, there is a sequence λ_n→0 such that u_(λ_n)-min u_(λ_n) uniformly converges to a continuous function u and -λ_n min u_(λ_n ) converges to a constant c. By the stability of viscosity solutions, (u,c) solves H(x,Du(x))=c. In [1], the authors proved that the convergence of u_λ is uniform as λ→0. In [2], the author proved that the solution u_λ of

λa(x)u(x)+H(x,Du(x))=0

is unique, where a(x)≥0 and a(x)>0 on the Aubry set of H(x,p). Moreover, the convergence of u_λ is uniform as λ→0. Following these works, I gave a counter example showing that {u_λ} may be divergent when a(x) vanishes on the Aubry set of H(x,p) or changes its signs.
