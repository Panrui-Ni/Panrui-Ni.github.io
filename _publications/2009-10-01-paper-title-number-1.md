This paper is about the existence of solutions of
\[H(x,Du(x),u(x))=c,\quad x\in M\]
and the large time behavior of solutions of
\[\partial_t u(x,t)+H(x,Du(x,t),u(x,t))=c,\quad (x,t)\in M\times (0,+\infty),\]
where the Hamiltonian is periodic in the unknown function. We prove that the set of all c such that the first equation has solutions is a compact interval. We also proved that the solutions of the second equation is uniformly bounded and equi-Lipschitz when the first equation is solvable.
