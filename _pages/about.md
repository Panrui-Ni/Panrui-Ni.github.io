Welcome to my webpage! I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr/), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), CNRS. I obtained my PhD degree from [Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University.

I was advised by [Prof. Jun Yan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jun-Yan-79) at Fudan University. Now my mentor is [Prof. Maxime Zavidovique](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~maxime.zavidovique/).

My research interest includes Hamiltonian dynamics, Hamilton-Jacobi Equations, Weak KAM Theory and Aubry-Mather theory.

Office: Campus Pierre et Marie Curie 15–25 501, 75005 Paris, France.
