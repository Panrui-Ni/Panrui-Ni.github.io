This paper is about the existence of solutions of

H(x,Du(x),u(x))=c,

and the large time behavior of solutions of

∂_t u(x,t)+H(x,∂_x u(x,t),u(x,t))=0

where the Hamiltonian H is periodic in the unknown function u. We prove that the set of all c's such that the first equation has viscosity solutions is a compact interval. We also proved that the solutions of the second equation is uniformly bounded and equi-Lipschitz continuous when the first equation is solvable.
