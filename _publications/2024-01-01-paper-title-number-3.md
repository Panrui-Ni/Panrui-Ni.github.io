In this work, we generalized the dynamical assumptions in

[1] Wang, K., Wang, L. and Yan, J., Variational principle for contact Hamiltonian systems and its applications, J. Math. Pures Appl., 123 (2019), 167-200.

to the standard PDE assumptions, that is, H(x,u,p) is continuous, convex and coercive in p, uniformly Lipschitz in u. As its applications, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the viscosity solutions of the stationary equations. Moreover, we prove a new comparison theorem depending on the neighborhood of the projected Aubry set essentially, which is different from the one for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation independent of u. An example is constructed to show that the requirement of the neighborhood is necessary for a special class of Hamilton-Jacobi equations that do not satisfy the “proper” condition.
