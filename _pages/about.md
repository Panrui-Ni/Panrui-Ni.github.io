I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr/), and obtained my PhD degree from [Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Hamiltonian systems, Hamilton-Jacobi Equations, Aubry-Mather Theory, Weak KAM Theory and Mean Field Games.
